The project constitutes of a command-line Advanced Customer Relationship Management (CRM) system, leveraging Java's object-oriented capabilities and Collections Framework.The program(code) utilizes the 
Customer class to encapsulate customer information, including name, email, and contact details, with the ability to track preferences and purchases.The application employs a menu-driven interface facilitated 
by the Scanner class, allowing users to add customers, view customer details, search for customers, delete customers, add notes to customers, and view customer notes. Exception handling is implemented to 
manage invalid user inputs gracefully. The program's core functionalities, executed within a loop until the user opts to exit, make it a versatile tool for customer management.This CRM system serves as a 
foundational structure that can be expanded and customized for more sophisticated business needs, showcasing the flexibility and utility of Java in developing practical applications for customer-centric 
operations. However, additional features like database integration could be introduced for robust data storage.
